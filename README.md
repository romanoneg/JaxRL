# JaxRL
learning jax, specifically for RL

Very Very simple RL agents built in Jax, with (sometimes!) pytorch equivalents.

As a very quick preliminary test here are the times each script took to solve CartPole-v1:

REINFORCE_pytorch       - 9m12s

REINFORCE_jax           - 58.6s

vmap_REINFORCE_jax      - 40.0s

pmap_vmap_REINFORCE_jax - TODO
